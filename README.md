# 👋 Hi, I'm Tulsi Kumar!  

**AI and Robotics Engineer | NLP  | Computer Vision | Deep Learning** 

I specialize in **Large Language Models (LLMs), deep learning, and computer vision**, working on AI-driven solutions for **text and image processing**. My work involves **developing, optimizing, and applying AI models** for real-world applications, from **LLM-based text analysis** to **computer vision tasks like object detection and anomaly detection**.  

## **What I Work on**  
 🧠 **LLMs & NLP** – RAG, Chatbots, Text processing, keyword extraction, and automation  
 📸 **Computer Vision** – VLMs,Object detection, segmentation, and anomaly detection  
 ⚡ **Model Optimization** – Lightweight architectures, pruning, quantization, and distillation  
 🤖 **Human-Robot Interaction** – AI-powered reasoning for interactive systems 

## **Featured Projects**  
* [**LW-DETR**](https://github.com/tulsikumar-1/lw-detr) – Lightweight DETR-based object detection model.   
* [**Multi-Robot Simulator (ROS)**](https://github.com/tulsikumar-1/Multi_robot_simulator-ROS) – Path-Planning multi-agent simulation.
* [**Tic-Tac-Toe with Pepper**](https://github.com/tulsikumar-1/Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Pepper) – Human-Robot Interaction with AI-powered decision-making.
* [**Story Generation Using Keywords**](https://github.com/tulsikumar-1/Story-generation-using-keywords) – AI-generated narratives from keyword prompts.
* [**Keyword Extraction from Text**](https://github.com/tulsikumar-1/Important-Keyword-Extraction-From-text) – Extracting important words from documents.
