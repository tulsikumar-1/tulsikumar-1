# 👋 Hi, I'm Tulsi Kumar!  

**AI and Robotics Engineer | NLP  | Computer Vision | Deep Learning** 

I specialize in **Large Language Models (LLMs), deep learning, and computer vision**, working on AI-driven solutions for **text and image processing**. My work involves **developing, optimizing, and applying AI models** for real-world applications, from **LLM-based text analysis** to **computer vision tasks like object detection and anomaly detection**.  

## **What I Work on**  
 🧠 **LLMs & NLP** – RAG, Chatbots, Text processing, keyword extraction, and automation  
 📸 **Computer Vision** – VLMs,Object detection, segmentation, and anomaly detection  
 ⚡ **Model Optimization** – Lightweight architectures, pruning, quantization, and distillation  
 🤖 **Human-Robot Interaction** – AI-powered reasoning for interactive systems 

## **Featured Projects**
